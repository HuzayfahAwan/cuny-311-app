# 🏙️ CUNY 311 App

## 📌 Overview

The **CUNY 311 App** is a full-stack web platform that helps **CUNY students, staff, and faculty** report campus issues quickly and easily.
Users can file complaints **anonymously** or **with contact info**, while administrators can review, filter, export, and mark complaints as resolved from a dashboard.

---

## 🚧 Problem Statement

Campus issues like **broken sinks, AC failures, Wi-Fi outages, or safety concerns** are often reported through slow, inconsistent channels.
This leads to:

* Delays in fixing problems
* Poor accountability and tracking
* Student frustration

The **CUNY 311 App** provides one consistent, digital channel for reporting, reviewing, and resolving issues across all CUNY campuses.
